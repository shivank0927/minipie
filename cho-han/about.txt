Cho-han is a dice game played in gambling
houses of feudal Japan. Two six-sided dice
are rolled in a cup, and gamblers must guess
if the sum is even (cho) or odd (han). The
house takes a small cut of all winnings. The simple
random number generation and basic math used to
determine odd or even sums make this project espe-
cially suitable for beginners

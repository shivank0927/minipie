Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular autom-
ata simulation that follows simple rules to
create interesting patterns. It was invented
by mathematician John Conway in 1970 and
popularized by Martin Gardner’s “Mathematical
Games” column in Scientific American.
it’s more an interesting visualization than a true “game.” The two-
dimensional board has a grid of “cells,” each of which follows three simple
rules:

    • Living cells with two or three neighbors stay alive in the next step of the
    simulation.
    • Dead cells with exactly three neighbors become alive in the next step of
    the simulation.
    • Any other cell dies or stays dead in the next step of the simulation.

The living or dead state of the cells in the next step of the simula-
tion depends entirely on their current state. The cells don’t “remember”
any older states. There is a large body of research regarding the patterns
that these simple rules produce.
